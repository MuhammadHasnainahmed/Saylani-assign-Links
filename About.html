    <h1>About Pages</h1>
    <p>As a frontend developer with a focus on UI/UX, I create the visual elements
        and user experience of websites and applications. I design and implement
        features that make the digital world easy to navigate and visually appealing.
        My goal is to ensure that users have a seamless and enjoyable experience
        while interacting with the product. I use a mix of coding languages like HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript to bring designs to life, making sure they not only look
        great but also function smoothly across different devices and platforms
